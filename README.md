# ranges
A more refined version of interval arithmetic for 64 bit systems.

Currently the code is a mess, and will stay that way for a while.

I've figured out how to do addition & subtraction correctly and apply some reductions correctly, but I haven't figured out multiplication or division yet, or anything more complex than that. Also, addition and subtraction are quite inefficient.Ideally, this would be addressable in the future.
